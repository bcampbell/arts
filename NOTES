# Notes - stuff that needs some thought and more work


## improve 'read more' cruft removal

eg:

https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/politics/1138354/mp-uses-limerick-to-mock-hereditary-peers-return-to-the-house-of-lords-after-an-election-with-just-three-voters/

Has a 'read more' block embedded in it, with a bunch of links to other articles.

### Plan

Look for indicative text ("read more", "related articles" etc), and disregard
any links which immediately follow.
